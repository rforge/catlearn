2017-07-03,Andy emails Anna to ask "How's it going?"
2017-07-11,Anna commits to altSIM as a free software project (mainly GPL, but some BSD for code from the Matlab File Exchange).
2017-08-31,Anna has sent me the ALTsim code. My initial review of this code suggests that the backend model functions could be reused in catlearn via Octave. The GUI heavily depends on MATLAB-only functionality so is not re-usuable in a free software project. I asked for something I could use to run the backend functions without the GUI.
2017-11-08,Request not yet answered
2017-11-08,v.0.6 release?

** CAL-R

Andy and Angus had discussions with the CAL-R team in 2016 but we hit a brick wall with CAL-R's licence conditions (it isn't free software)

2017-11-08,Andy is now maintainer of grt package
2017-11-08,grt interoperability wrapper for v.0.6?

** lazyNut schema

2017-03-02,James Adelman to develop code to allow lazyNut simulations to inter-operate with catlearn (Colin Davis is also a contact point for this work, but James is the programmer).
2017-05-04,Andy nudges Colin Davis who says he will respond by 12-May
2017-07-03,Andy decides he has insufficient time to pursue this for v.0.5 release-will consider again for version 0.6
2017-11-08,Andy has downloaded the code. There seems to be some enthusiasm for the inter-operability project from Colin, but none from James Adelman (the programmer) who Colin reports as feeling that it's against the spirit of the project to use the backend as a library.
2017-11-08,lazyNut inter-operability wrapper for v.0.6?
