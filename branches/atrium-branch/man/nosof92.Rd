\title{Exemplar vs Prototype Theory CIRP}
\description{

  Medin and Schaffer (1978, Experiment 2) trained participants to categorise
  nine four-dimensional stimuli into either 'A' or 'B' categories. They then
  tested participants on all possible stimuli including two training stimuli
  designed to distinguish between exemplar and prototype accounts of category
  learning (See e.g Medin and Schaffer 1978, Figure 4, for details). It is
  presumed that better accuracy on the stimulus closer to the category prototype
  supports a prototype account, whilst better accuracy on the stimulus  that is
  more similar to more members of the category supports an exemplar account. The
  CIRP concerns the results that participants have greater accuracy on the 
  second stimulus and poor accuracy on the first, a result generally taken
  in support of exemplar theories. The dataset reported in this CIRP is from 
  Nosofsky, Kruschke and McKinley (1992, Experiment 2).

\details{

  Derivation of this CIRP is discussed in terms of defining a CIRP within Wills,
  O'Connell, Edmunds and Inkster (2017). This is a well-demonstrated effect 
  (Blair and Homa, 2003; Minda and Smith, 2002; Nosofsky, Kruschke and McKinley,
  1992; Nosofsky, Palmeri and McKinley, 1994; Rehder and Hoffman, 2005). There
  is some debate about the generality of the ordinal result across different
  stimulus sets and procedures (Nosofsky, 2000; Smith and Minda, 2000), but there
  is a consensus that the ordinal effect is robust within the experimental
  conditions of the original Medin and Schaffer (1978, Experiment 2) study.
  
  Nosofsky et al. (1992, Experiment 2) was selected as the CIRP because it had
  acceptable sample size (N=40), and included simulations of the results with a
  number of different formal models. Inclusion of this dataset in \code{catlearn}
  thus permits a validation of \code{catlearn} model implementations against 
  published simulations.
  
  In Nosofsky et al. (1992) the stimuli varied in size (large or small), shape 
  (triangles or squares), type of interior lines (dotted or dashed) and density
  of interior lines (high or low). Each participant received 4 blocks of 63
  training trials using the 9 training stimuli seen in Table 4 of Nosofsky et 
  al. (1992). They made a judgement as to whether the stimulus belonged to 
  Category A or Category B and received corrective feedback. Following each
  training block, a transfer phase was conducted containing the full 16 stimuli
  from Table 4 of Nosofsky et al. (1992). These stimuli were presented without 
  corrective feedback. Order of stimulus presentation was randomised during
  training and transfer.
