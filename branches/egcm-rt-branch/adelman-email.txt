Dear Andy,

I have now located the source code for the model.

All the fitting already happens via R, but the C++ code is compiled as a shared object (or dll) library, with -DSHARED.

It is then loaded as
dyn.load(“egcmmatrixfix4.so”)

Then there are a couple of R wrappers, which for the final model are:

egcmpredraw<- function(p) .C("egcm",p,pr=double(p[1]*p[1]),rt=double(p[1]))

egcmpred2cc<- function(dur,set,params,els,spac) {(Vectorize(function(dur,set,params,el,spac) {egcmpredraw(c(set,els,ifelse(spac==1,ifelse(set==6,params[2],params[3]),ifelse(set==6,params[4],params[5])),params[6],params[7],params[8:9],dur))->x ; x},vectorize.args=c("dur","set","spac")))(dur,set,params,els,spac)->temp; list(pr=unlist(temp[2,]),rt=params[1]+unlist(temp[3,]))}

Best,

Hi James,

Congratulations on your recently accepted paper at JEP:LMC on absolute
identification!

Chris Kent suggested I contact you  about the
possibility of using your PMEGCM-RT code within the 'catlearn'
package. Hopefully you've already heard a bit about catlearn from both
Chris Kent and Colin Davis, if not I'm happy to expand on the
topic. In brief, it's a free and open archive of model
implementations, classic datasets against which to test them, and
simulation archives.

It'd be great to have PMEGCM-RT as one of the model implementations,
and I'm strongly motivated to see this work, so I stand ready to help
in whatever way I can. I think the publication of models and CIRP
(canonical independently-replicated phenomena) is crucial to efficient
progress in formal modelling.

I seem to recall Chris saying your implementation was written in C -
catlearn supports C (via RCpp, which I have some experience of
using).

Anyway, let me know what you think and, if it's a go-er, how I can
help.

All the best

Andy
