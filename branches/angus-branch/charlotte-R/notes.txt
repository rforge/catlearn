Hi guys,

So I've done a version of COVIS in R (mainly couldn't be bothered to debug
in MATLAB and also have no ideas whether I'd miss a slight difference in
implementation between various COVIS versions). It's attached along with a
lovely graph. Sorry it's not optimised.

Several things I noticed when doing this that I didn't quiz Angus about
(you may have already dealt with this but thought would type out as well,
just in case):
1. The implementation of the category structure in terms of 0s and 1s
matters - especially for the II category structure. If you have 7/8th of
the stimuli the same as an optimum rule (i.e. going to the correct category
label) COVIS will learn the II structure. If, however, you do it the other
way around it will take a few thousand trials - not really what they were
hoping for I think.
2. I've added a whole bunch of []+ functions where they are not included in
the model (around the learning of the weights and saliences in the
rule-based) - otherwise I got negative saliences. However, this may just be
because I included a bug (now fixed), so will double check whether that's
necessary or not.
3. I've also included the learning criteria as used in WA2001: training
finishes if there are 8 correct trials in a row OR they hit 200 trials,
whichever comes first. I didn't ask Angus whether he had done the same.

Hope this was helpful,
I'm in University tomorrow if you both were free and would like to chat
about it all?

Charlotte

p.s. if you find a bug I haven't, could you let me know? Practice makes
perfect and all that
