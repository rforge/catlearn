[x] looking at writing functions for cluster activations

- output refinement
[x] include probability of making the right response for nominal values
[x] include output activation for queried dimensions ot all of it in unsup
[x] everything that changes

- supervised bug
[x] wrong cluster activations
[x] updating clusters?
[ ] type3 problem is not doing that well
    instead of the first two dimension, lambda leans toward
    the second and third dimension, so it recruits seven clusters
    instead of six, but it might be right

- unsupervised adjustments:
[x] probabilities

- frozen learning
[x] 'ctrl' coloumn 0, 1, 2
    > 0 = training trial
    > 1 = reset state
    > 2 = freeze learning
[ ] xout[i] = 99 if ctrl = 2

- documentation
[?] whatnot
[x] ctrl coloumn update
[x] values update
[x] hyphens are processed as question marks in ASCII
[x] weights description
