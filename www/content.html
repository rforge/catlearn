<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Wills et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive introduction to the
catlearn package. In brief:

<p>Formal models are useful in psychology when they allow unambiguous
comparison of the relative adequacy of theories across a broad range
of phenomena (Wills & Pothos, 2012). However, the goal of broad
comparison is not achievable by any one individual within a reasonable
amount of time (Wills et al., 2016). Catlearn is designed to solve
this problem by enabling efficient distributed collaboration.

Catlearn is a framework and archive for formal modeling in psychology.
It makes use of R's in-built documentation system to build an archival
record of Canonical Independently Replicated Phenomena, an archive of
formal models implemented as stateful list processors, and an archive
of simulations. It is intended to supplement, rather than supplant,
traditional publication routes. In particular, the documentation
within catlearn is concise to the point of terseness, and
does not obviate the need for more fulsome descriptions provided
through traditional publication routes.

Wills et al. (2016) provide a tutorial introduction to catlearn. 

<h1>Installation</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version of R from <a href =
"https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.

  <li>(optional but recommended for those new to R) Install <a href =
  "https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>

  <li>Install catlearn:
  <ul> 
     <li><b>Stable version</b> (choose this if unsure): From within R,
     type: <p>install.packages('catlearn')
     <li><i>Unstable version</i> (latest features): From within R,
     type: <p>install.packages('catlearn',
     repos='http://R-Forge.R-project.org') <p><b>NOTE</b>: In order to
     install the unstable version on a Mac or a Linux machine, you
     will need to install additional software for building R packages
     from source. These are available on CRAN, in the same place you
     download R. Windows users do not need to worry about this.
  </ul>
