<p>Catlearn is a <b>framework and archive</b> for <b>distributed
    collaboration</b> in formal modeling in psychology</b>.  It
    provides an archival record of:

<ol>
<li>Canonical Independently Replicated Phenomena (i.e. key datasets),
<li>formal models
<li>simulations. 
</ol>

It supplements, rather than supplants, journal article publication.

<p>Wills et al. (2016) provide a tutorial introduction to catlearn. 

<h1>Mailing list</h1> Join the 
<a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/mailman/listinfo/catlearn-package">
catlearn-package</a> e-mail list to get occasional information on
updates to the catlearn package.

<h1>Current contents</h1>

<p>Catlearn is intended as a framework for distributed collaboration;
please consider contributing content (models, datasets, simulations)
to this project.

<p>The latest stable version of catlearn (v. 0.3) contains the following:

<ul>
<li>6 archived simulations
<li>3 input representations
<li>3 CIRP (i.e. datasets)
<li>1 model implementation (ALCOVE)
</ul>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version of R from <a href =
"https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.

  <li>(optional but recommended for those new to R) Install <a href =
  "https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>

  <li>Install catlearn:
  <ul> 
     <li><b>Stable version</b> (choose this if unsure): From within R,
     type: <p>install.packages('catlearn')
     <li><i>Unstable version</i> (latest features): From within R,
     type: <p>install.packages('catlearn',
     repos='http://R-Forge.R-project.org') <p><b>NOTE</b>: In order to
     install the unstable version on a Mac or a Linux machine, you
     will need to install additional software for building R packages
     from source. These are available on CRAN, in the same place you
     download R. Windows users do not need to worry about this.
  </ul> 
</ol>

<h1>Talks and workshops</h1>

<h2>Forthcoming</h2>

<b>Introduction to catlearn</b> (1 hour lecture)
<br><i>Andy Wills</i>, Wed 18th Jan 2017, 4pm.
<br>School of Psychology, Plymouth University, UK.
<br><b>FREE</b>. Contact <i>andy@willslab.co.uk</i> for details. 

<h2>Invited talks</h2>

The Catlearn Research Group are keen to talk about the catlearn
project to any interested party (academic or non-academic). Why not
invite us to give a talk or run a workshop where you are? We do not
charge an appearance fee, but would prefer it if you were able to
reimburse our travel expenses, including accommodation.

<p>The Catlearn Research Group are based in the United Kingdom,
at <a href = "https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/">Plymouth University</a>
