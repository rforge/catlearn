<p>Catlearn is a <b>framework and archive</b> for <b>distributed
    collaboration</b> in formal modeling in psychology</b>.  It
    provides an archival record of:

<ol>
<li>Canonical Independently Replicated Phenomena (i.e. key datasets),
<li>formal models
<li>simulations. 
</ol>

It supplements, rather than supplants, journal article publication.
<h1> Getting started</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/wills2016plm.pdf">Wills
      et al. (2017)</a> provide a tutorial introduction to distributed
      collaboration and catlearn.
  <li>a 20 min
    <a href="http://www.willslab.org.uk/vid/catlearn-intro.mp4">
      video</a> introduction to distributed collaboration and catlearn
      (based on a conference presentation at the Experimental
      Psychology Society conference, London, Jan 2017).
</ul>


  <h1>Mailing list</h1>
  Join the 
  <a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/mailman/listinfo/catlearn-package">
    catlearn-package</a> e-mail list to get occasional information on
  updates to the catlearn package.

  <h1>Current contents</h1>

<p>Catlearn is intended as a framework for distributed collaboration;
please consider contributing content (models, datasets, simulations)
to this project.

<p>The latest stable version of catlearn (v. 0.4) contains the
following:

<ul>
<li>6 archived simulations
<li>4 model implementations (ALCOVE, COVIS, DIVA, Rescorla-Wagner)
<li>3 input representations
<li>3 CIRP (i.e. datasets)
</ul>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version of R from <a href =
"https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.

  <li>(optional but recommended for those new to R) Install <a href =
  "https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>

  <li>Install catlearn:
  <ul> 
     <li><b>Stable version (v. 0.4) </b> (choose this if unsure): From
     within R, type: <p>install.packages('catlearn')
     <li><i>Unstable version</i> (latest features): From within R,
     type: <p>install.packages('catlearn',
     repos='http://R-Forge.R-project.org') <p><b>NOTE</b>: In order to
     install the unstable version on a Mac or a Linux machine, you
     will need to install additional software for building R packages
     from source. These are available on CRAN, in the same place you
     download R. Windows users do not need to worry about this.
  </ul> 
</ol>

<h2>Invite us to give a talk or workshop?</h2>

The Catlearn Research Group are keen to talk about the catlearn
project to any interested party (academic or non-academic). Why not
invite us to give a talk or run a workshop where you are? We do not
charge an appearance fee, but would prefer it if you were able to
reimburse our travel expenses, including accommodation.

<p>The Catlearn Research Group are based in the United Kingdom,
at <a href = "https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/">Plymouth University</a>
